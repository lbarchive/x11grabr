x11grabr
========

This is an extended work after I submitted two patchs to [libav][] for mouse following and grabbing region indicator. I believe that any further development is better off libav, and it would be better to be a standalone program.

[libav]: http://libav.org/

Current Status
--------------

In this very first stage, x11grabr tries to do the same as it is in libav.

Currently, x11grabr requires libav/ffmpeg to build, make sure their header files is in search path. Simply run `make` should do the trick, then you should be able to run a comannd as follows:

    ./x11grabr | ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pix_fmt bgra -s hd720 -r 25 -i - test.mp4

The video size and frame rate are fixed in code, there will be options once I make it not require libav/ffmpeg.

Development
-----------

If you are interested in this, be sure you check out `TODO.mkd` in source files, so you know what I have in mind.

License
-------

GPLv2, because `x11grab.c` is licensed under it.
