Issues
------

 * Audio could be out of sync.

Basic
-----

 * Make building standalone, don't link against libav/ffmpeg.
 * Options parsing.
 * Benchmarking - allows to use options for testing output FPS.

Options
-------

 * show_region border style and color.
 * no output pixel data. Just discard image data from X.
 * Pointer highlighter (off-screen rendering like mouse pointer drawing):
   * Following - A simple circle below the pointer.
   * Clicks - Change colors to indicate mouse clicks.
     * Could indicate using region border, changing color maybe.
   * Modifier - Allows to render modifier in text.
     * Could indicate using region border, changing color maybe.

Commands
--------

There will be no keybindings in x11grabr, a FIFO will be used to accept
commands and to return results. This potentially can be used with frontend, if
someone prefers GUI.

 * Add FIFO for commands input and results output.
 * Zooming out to full-screen.
 * Flexible zooming.

Possibilities
-------------

 * Changing output pix format - libav/ffmpeg has flexible input format, you can
   pretty much feed it any kind of format. This would only be implemented if
   there is such program requires different out pix format.
 * Extensions:
   * Pre-grabbing - allows to modify what will be used to grab the screen.
   * Post-grabbing - extensions will be supplied with image data and they can
     do whatever they need to.
   * Once this is implemented, draw_mouse can be moved to post-grabbing.
     follow_mouse and show_region can be moved to pre-grabbing. Users can use
     different extensions if they don't like the defaults.
 * allows to spawn libav/ffmpeg, so only type in one command
   * eg. ./x11grab -s hd720 -r 25 -- ~/test.mp4

Wish list
---------

Not gonna happen if no one submits patches.

 * Windows
 * Mac
